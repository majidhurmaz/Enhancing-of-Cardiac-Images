    "<p align='justify'> In the world of digital imagery, it is often desirable to enhance the quality of images to make them more visually appealing or improve their clarity. With the help of Python and the OpenCV library, we can implement various techniques to enhance the quality of images. In this blog, we will explore a simple code snippet that demonstrates how to enhance image quality using OpenCV in Python.</p>"

    "**Code Explanation:**\n",
    "<p justify='justify'> The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, including OpenCV. It then defines a function called enhance_image that takes an image as input and applies image processing techniques to enhance its quality. In this example, we demonstrate the application of unsharp masking for sharpening the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsharp masking is a popular technique that involves creating a blurred version of the image and then subtracting it from the original image to enhance the edges and details. The resulting image is a combination of the original image and the blurred version, weighted accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enhance_image function converts the image to grayscale and applies unsharp masking using the OpenCV functions GaussianBlur and addWeighted. </p>"
